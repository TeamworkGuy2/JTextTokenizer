JTextTokenizer
==============
version: 0.2.1

CharParser and CharParserFactory implementations ([jtext-parser](https://github.com/TeamworkGuy2/JTextParser) library) for text tokenization including:
* conditions (`CharParsers` implementations for string contains, literal, end-not-preceded-by, etc),
* compound conditions (start filter, end filter, filter),
* condition pipes (all required, optional suffix, all required, repeatable separator),
* string conditions (start, end, literal) which form the basis for all the conditions.
