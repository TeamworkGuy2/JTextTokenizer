JTextTokenizer
==============
version: 0.2.0

CharParser and CharParserFactory implementations (jtext-parser library) for text tokenization including:
* conditions (CharParsers implementations for string contains, literal, end-not-preceded-by, etc),
* compound conditions (start filter, end filter, filter),
* condition pipes (all required, optional suffix, all required, repeatable separator),
* string conditions (start, end, literal) which form the basis for all the conditions.
